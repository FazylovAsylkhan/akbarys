The Ashyq system was installed in the office, which shows the status of all employees and visitors. This system will determine whether you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, whether you have passed a PCR test, or will show that you have confirmed COVID-19. Admission to the office is granted to employees who have shown a Neutral or Safe status and have passed mandatory thermometry.

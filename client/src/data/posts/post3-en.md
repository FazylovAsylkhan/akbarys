Ashyq was implemented in the office to show the status of all employees and visitors. This system will determine if you have been vaccinated against COVID-19, if you have had a PCR test, or it shows that you have COVID-19 confirmed. Employees shall be admitted to the office only with the Neutral or Safe status demonstrated and mandatory thermometry taken.
